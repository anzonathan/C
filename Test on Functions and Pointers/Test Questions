### Question 1: Basic Functions  
Uganda Christian University wants to help students practice basic arithmetic  
operations. Write a function `int add(int a, int b)` that takes two integers as  
arguments and returns their sum. Then, write a program that:  
- Reads two integers from the user.  
- Calls the `add` function with these integers.  
- Prints the result.  

### Question 2: Array Initialization and Sum Calculation  
The university wants to track the scores of students in a quiz. Write a program  
that:  
- Initializes an array of 5 integers with scores entered by the user.  
- Calculates and prints the sum of the scores.  

### Question 3: Finding Maximum in an Array  
The university needs to find the highest score among a group of students. Write  
a function `int findMax(int arr[], int size)` that returns the maximum value in an  
array. Then, write a program that:  
- Initializes an array of 5 integers with scores entered by the user.  
- Calls the `findMax` function and prints the highest score. 

### Question 4: Using Pointers  
Write a program that:  
- Declares an integer variable and a pointer to that integer.  
- Assigns a value to the integer using both the variable and the pointer.  
- Prints the value of the integer and the address stored in the pointer.  

### Question 5: Swapping Values Using Pointers (Slightly Harder)  
Uganda Christian University is managing student seating arrangements. Write a  
function `void swap(int* a, int* b)` that swaps the values of two integers using  
pointers. Then, write a program that:  
- Reads two integers representing seat numbers from the user.  
- Calls the `swap` function with these seat numbers.  
- Prints the swapped seat numbers.
