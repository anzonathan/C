/*Develop a program to find the roots of a quadratic equation and analyze its nature:
Write a C program that:
•    Prompts the user to enter the coefficients of a quadratic equation (a, b, and c) in the standard form ax² + bx + c = 0. 
•    Uses a function to calculate the discriminant (D = b² - 4ac). 
•    Uses another function to determine the nature of the roots based on the discriminant: - If D > 0, the roots are real and distinct. - If D = 0, the roots are real and equal. - If D < 0, the roots are complex. 
•    If the roots are real, calculates and displays them using the quadratic formula: - x1 = (-b + √D) / 2a - x2 = (-b - √D) / 2a 
•    If the roots are complex, displays them in the form: - x1 = -b / 2a + i * (√-D) / 2a - x2 = -b / 2a - i * (√-D) / 2a where 'i' is the imaginary unit (√-1).
ps: Use a function and parameter passing*/
